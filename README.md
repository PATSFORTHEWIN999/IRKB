# Interdisciplinary Research Knowledge Base (IRKB)

We believe the large amount of single cell and other omics data available in the public domain conceive valuable information in characterizing cellular biological properties in different tissue microenvironments, analogous analysis on which can provide substantial novel insights to the fundamental biological understanding in biochemistry, molecular and cell biology.

The central goal of this knowledge base is to provide resources to pioneer the development of biological explainable methodologies in single cell data study.

## Goal

1. Developing a series of computational methods to predict gene sets, networks, or specific data representations in single cell and other omics data that annotate the biological characteristics in different tissue contexts.
2. Providing a high quality Testbed 
3. Facilitating the interactive method



## Key components:

- [Major Research Topics](https://github.com/zcslab/IRKB/tree/master/Components):
1. Construction a transcriptomics reference map to annotate cell type and cell type specific functions in different bain microenvironments
