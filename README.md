# Interdisciplinary Research Knowledge Base (IRKB)


We believe the large amount of single cell and other omics data available in the public domain conceive valuable information in characterizing cellular biological properties in different tissue microenvironments, analogous analysis on which can provide substantial novel insights to the fundamental biological understanding in biochemistry, molecular and cell biology.

The central goal of this knowledge base is to provide resources to pioneer the development of biological explainable methodologies in single cell data study.

Tackling the challenges involves an interdisciplinary education approach that can translate the state-of-the-art topics, problem setups, research language, and benchmark and metrics between the fields of artificial intelligence, data mining, computational biology and biotechnology. 

We will leverage the translation of the topics from different research fields by providing a series of computational challenges and a well annotated data Testbed.

The educational component will also be designed for facilitating the training of future scientists from college and high school STEM students. College and high school intern students in Biomedical Data Research Lab at Indiana University School of Medicine (PI: Drs.Chi Zhang and Sha Cao) will be directly involved in the construction of this knowledge base, with a specific focus on the educational component.



## Goal

1. Developing a series of computational methods to predict gene sets, networks, or specific data representations in single cell and other omics data that annotate the biological characteristics in different tissue contexts.
2. Providing a high quality Testbed 
3. Facilitating the interactive methodology developments between computer scientists, statistician and computational biologists
4. Providing educational
